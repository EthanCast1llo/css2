    <center><h2>My Story</h2></center>
   
        <p>As a ninth-grade student at Pasig Community School Foundation Incorporated, I'm on a journey to explore and capture the world through different lenses - both literally and figuratively. My passion for photography allows me to tell stories through images, freezing moments in time that might otherwise go unnoticed in our fast-paced world.</p>
        <p>When I'm not in the classroom, you'll likely find me on the badminton court, where I channel my competitive spirit and dedication to continuous improvement. The sport has taught me valuable lessons about persistence, strategy, and the importance of staying focused under pressure.</p>
        <p> My fascination with automotive technology runs deep. From classic cars to modern sports cars, I'm always eager to learn about the latest innovations in the automotive industry. This interest goes beyond mere appreciation - it's about understanding the engineering marvels that shape our modern transportation.</p>
        <p>One of my greatest joys comes from hitting the open road. I love embarking on road trips with family and friends, combining my passion for cars with my love for photography. These journeys not only feed my adventurous spirit but also provide endless opportunities to capture stunning moments through my camera lens</p>
